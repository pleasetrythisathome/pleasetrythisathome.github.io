# I make things and also stuff and you can pay me for both

# TL;DR

My rate is $150/hour. I give discounts if you pay me more. Sometimes I work for less on social good projects.

I bill by 30 min pomodoro period of uninterrupted work on a focused task. 1 pomodoro = 1 hour of total work. But wait, you say, that’s twice as much time! All organization, task management, communication, eating, chatting, etc is on my time. Read on my friend, there is a method to the madness.

Here’s how I work.

# The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique was developed by [Francesco Cirillo](https://caps.ucsd.edu/Downloads/tx_forms/koch/pomodoro_handouts/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf). The basic gist is work on a single task without any interruption or distraction for 25 minutes, take 5 minutes off (I prefer to stand up and do something physical like handstands), and repeat for a total of 4 cycles, before taking a 30 minute break. This leads to a “full cycle” of 2.5 hours.

# The Standard Work Day

The standard work day is generally considered to be 8 hours. There seems to be little agreement of what happens when during these 8 hours, but an hour for lunch is considered standard.

I define a standard workday under a “normal” 8 hour period as follows.

Duration (hours) - Task
0.5 - Misc
2.5 - One full pomodoro cycle (4 pomodoros)
1   - Meeting
1   - Lunch
2.5 - One full pomodoro cycle (4 pomodoros)
0.5 - Misc

Total
8 hours
8 pomodoro cycles
1 meeting
1 hour misc

# Time Tracking

I track all tasks with [Trello](https://trello.com/). I use a mix of scrum and kanban, depending on the project and the workflow of the rest of the team. 1 Board per project.

I track pomodoros with [Pomello](http://www.pomelloapp.com/), an integrated timer that posts number of pomodoros (and notes, etc) to trello cards.

I make a done list for each week, and move cards to done as they are completed. At the end of the week, if any cards are outstanding and have cycles posted to them, they get put in done and duplicate cards get created for next week without cycles.

Cycles in the done list get totaled, the total gets added to the list title (ie. done (42): DD/MM/YYYY - DD/MM/YYYY).

I go over 25 minutes a lot. This doesn’t get posted. I wish it did. I actually use another timer called [Tadam](http://tadamapp.com) at the same time because it puts a massive gray window over my screen when it goes off. Regardless, I often extend the timer to finish something I’m in the middle of.

# Billing

1 hour = $150. I sometimes work for less on social good projects, or for close friends. If that’s you, let’s talk!

1 hour billable time = 1 pomodoro.

See above. 8 hours in standard workday, 8 pomodoro cycles.

Hourly billing is due on Net30 Terms.

I give discounts if I do more work for you.

< 8 hours / week     = $150/hr
8 - 32 hours / week = $150/hr - 10% = $135/hr

If you’d prefer to bill on a day or week rate, that’s great. If you pay on Net7 terms each period, direct deposit or wire greatly preferred, I’ll give you 10% off.

I work 4 days a week for other people, and 1 for myself. If you want to schedule days, that’s fine.

Day     =  $1,200   (8 hours $150/hr)
Week  =  $4,320   (4 days - 10%)
Month =  $15,360 (16 days - 20%)

I will do the same tracking as above anyway. You’re welcome to make sure you feel like you’re getting the promised amount of time. If something comes up and you feel like you aren’t, tell me and we’ll work it out!

I do not believe that any of the ratios of the above time allocations change with less time commitment per week. If anything, I’ve found far more time is spent communicating than working. I’ll count that as the cost of doing business for me :).

# So Misc is you wasting time?

No. There are a million tasks that do not fit under pomodoros. Pomodoros are intended to be distraction free. This means no slack, no email - just the task at hand. The 5 minute break is not for answering emails, slack or anything else. It’s a break. It’s for standing up, stretching, doing a handstand, getting a breathe of fresh air!

Misc is time to do the rest. Sometimes it’s in blocks, represented at the start of the day. Most of the time, it’s between pomodoros. It’s trello management that is necessary to condense standup tasks into things that are actually worth working on in cycles. It’s that 5 minutes of sitting down by myself to figure out what I need to be working on. It’s reading something interesting that’s been passed off by a coworker or friend.

Basically, it’s all the stuff that most people do all the time during the day, pushed to the edges and away from focusing on tasks.

Again, 1 hour a day is conservative for the amount of time this stuff takes.

# Do you really have an hour meeting every day?

Yes. This is conservative. Daily stand-ups tend to take a minimum of 30 min. I prefer to treat calls as pomodoros, and keep them to 25 min. Hour calls should have 5 min break to digest content in the middle.

This time also accounts for time spent responding to slack and other forms of communication throughout the day. It’s the slack conversation that makes you start your next cycle 10 minutes late. It’s responding to emails, scheduling calls, etc. Curious how much time slack and email takes for you? Install [Rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) and check it out.

# Do you work consistent hours every day?

Sometimes. Sometimes I work in the morning and then again late at night.

This whole system is an attempt to first figure out how much real work I get done in a standard day, assign a more meaningful unit to it than the hour, and then track that instead of time.

Mostly it depends on the needs of my clients. If you have a project that is heavy on collaboration with a team that works 9-5, I can do that. If you don’t, I’d prefer to be more flexible. Sometimes weekends are a great time for work, I do that too.

# Are you a total time Nazi?

No. I’m actually pretty chill. But I used to be super unorganized and now I found what works for me. I still look at reddit sometimes. You can send me cat memes. I love cats ^.^

# Does anyone else work like this?

I hope so! [Here’s one](https://www.chriswinfield.com/40-pomodoro-workweek/).

# My project is super different and this doesn’t make sense!

Sounds interesting - let’s talk.
